### When to use Capital Letters in Title

###### ref: [Capitalization in Titles - Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-in-the-titles/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=10273012991&utm_targetid=dsa-1233402314764&gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YAgDAKY2CWcaxC3umBKCIhF9UHHhEohvgsTL3YB1h8PxeytjaSu2vRoCABAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/)

1. Usually, capitalize the nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and don't capitalize the prepositions, articles and conjunctions unless they're the first or last word.

> Shakespeare wrote *Romeo and Juliet*.

2. When it comes to prepositions, if the word contains six or more letters, it should be capitalized.

> "The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios" is the first short story in the collection.

### Comma Before 'And'

###### ref: [Comma Before And - Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-before-and/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=10273012991&utm_targetid=dsa-1233402314764&gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YJ0OqN1kmvPZVqP_2msErUhIsGdo-7rpXrPGRrcLmLF53x5H3K66KRoC528QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

1. The comma is optional when using it in a list of three or more items.

> The dog is young, well trained, and good natured.
> The dog is young, well trained and good natured.

2. The comma should not be used when only two items are mentioned.

> The dog is well trained and good natured.

3. The comma is needed to join two independent clauses unless the two independent clauses are very short and closely connected.

> On Monday we'll see the Eiffel Tower, and on Tuesday we'll visit the Louvre.
> Arthur cooked and Melvin cleaned.
