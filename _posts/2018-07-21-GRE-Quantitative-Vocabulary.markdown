#### 1.1 Integers

| English | Chinese | Remark & Example |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| **factor, divisor**   | n. 因子 <br>v. 因式分解 | When integers are multiplied, each of the multiplied integers is called a factor or divisor of the resulting product. <br>*eg:* --What are factors of 25?  --1,5,25,-1,-5,-25 **(notice the negative number)** |
| **multiple** <br>**divisible** | n. 倍数 <br>adj. 可除尽的 | *eg0:* 60 is a multiple of each of its factors and that 60 is divisible by each of its divisors. <br>*eg1:* The list of positive multiples of 25 has no end: 25, 50, 75, 100, ...<br>*eg2:* 1 is a factor of every integer, while 0 is a multiple of every integer.  1 is not a multiple of any integer except 1 and -1, while 0 is not a factor of any integer except 0. |
| **least common multiple** | 最小公倍数 | The least common multiple of two nonzero integers *c* and *d* is the least positive integer that is a multiple of both *c* and *d*. |
| **greatest common factor, greatest common divisor** | 最大公约数 | The greatest comon divisor of two nonzero integers *c* and *d* is the greatest positive integer that is a divisor of both *c* and *d*. |
| **quotient** | n. 商 | If *d* is not a divisor of *c*, the result can be viewed as a fraction or as a decimal, or as a quotient with a remainder. <br>*eg:* The result of 19 divided by 7 is the quotient 2 with remainder 5, or simply "2 remainder 5". |
| **remainder** | n. 余数 | *eg0:* 100 divided by 3 is 33 remainder 1. <br>*eg1:* -32 divided by 3 is -11 remainder 1, since the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to -32 is (-11)(3), or -33, which is 1 less than -32. **(notice the negative number)** <br>*eg2:* -13 = (-3)(5) + 2 |
| **even integer** | 偶数 | If an integer is divisible by 2, it is called an even integer; otherwise, it is an odd integer. |
| **odd integer** | 奇数 | |
| **prime number** | 质数 | A prime number is an integer than 1 that has only two positive divisors: 1 and itself. <br>*eg:* The integer 1 is not a prime number, and the integer 2 is the only number that is even. |
| **prime divisors** | 质因数 | Every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number or can be uniquely expressed as a product of factors that are prime numbers, or prime divisors. Such an expression is called a prime factorization. |
| **prime factorization** | 质数分解 | *eg:* $12 = (2^3)(3)$ |
| **composite number** | 合数 | An integer than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. |

| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **product**           | 乘积    |                                                              |

| **simple interest**   | 单利    | Simple interest is based only on the initial deposit, which serves as the amount on which interest is computed, called the princial, for the entire time period. <br>*eg:* If the amount *P* is invested at a *simple annual interest rate of r percent*, then the value V of the investment at the end of *t* years is given by the formula $\displaystyle V = P (1 + \frac {rt}{100})$. |
| **principal**         | 本金    |                                                              |
| **compound interest** | 复利    | In the case of compound interest, interest is added to the principal at regular time intervals, such as annually, quarterly, and monthly. Each time interest is added to the principal, the interest is said to be compounded. After each compounding, interest is earned on the new principal, which is the sum of the preceding principal and the interest just added. <br>*eg0:* If the amount *P* is invested at an *annual interest rate of r percent, compounded annually*, then the value *V* of the investment at the end of *t* years is given by the formula $\displaystyle V = P (1 + \frac{r}{100})^{t}$. <br>*eg1:* If the amount *P* is invested at an *annual interest rate of r percent, compounded n times per year*, then the value *V* of the investment at the end of *t* years is given by the formula $\displaystyle V = P (1 + \frac{r}{100})^{nt}$. |

#### 2.9 Graphs of Functions

> Notice the fine distinction between the graphs of equations and ones of functions.

In other words, you use the *x*-axis for the input and the *y*-axis for the output.

| **statistics, statistical measures**  | 统计量，统计度量                         | Data can be described numerically by various statistics, or statistical measures. These statistical measures are often grouped in three categories: measures of central tendency, measures of position, and measures of dispersion. |
| **central tendency**                  | 集中趋势（中心趋势，指均数、中数、众数） | Measures of central tendency indicate the "center" of the data along the number line and are usually reported as values that represent the data. There are three common measures of central tendency: 1. the arithmetic mean/average/mean; 2. the median; 3. the mode. |
| **arithmetica mean / average / mean** | 算术平均数                               |                                                              |
| **median**                            | 中位数                                   | The median is a measure of central tendency that is fairly unaffected by unusually high or low values relative to the rest of the data. |
| **mode**                              | 众数                                     | The mode of a list of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the list. |
| **weighted mean**                     | 加权平均数                               |                                                              |
| **weight**                     | 权重                               |                                                              |
| **position** | 位置，分位 | The three most basic positions, or locations, in a list of numerical data ordered from least to greatest are the beginning, the end, and the middle. It is useful here to label these as *L* for the least, *G* for the greatest, and *M* for the median. Aside from these, the most common measures of position are quartiles and percentiles. As with the mean and the median, the quartiles and percentiles may or may not themselves be values in the data. |
| **quartiles** | 四分位数 | There are three quartile numbers, called the first quartile ($Q_1$) , the second quartile ($Q_2$) , and the third quartile ($Q_3$) , that divide the data into four roughly equal groups. <br>There are various rules to determine the exact values of $Q_1$ and $Q_3$, and the most common rule is that $Q_1$ is the median of the first half of the data in the ordered list and $Q_3$ is the median of the second half of the data in the ordered list. <br>*eg:* 4 is in the first quartile. The phase "in a quartile" refers to being in one of the four groups determined by $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$. |
| **percentiles** | 百分位数 | There are 99 percentile numbers that divide the data into 100 roughly equal groups ($P_1, P_2, P_3, ... , P_{99}$) . Consequently, $Q_1 = P_{25}, M = Q_2 = P_{50}, Q_3 = P_{75}$. |
| **dispersion** | 散布，离差，差量 | Measures of dispersion indicate the degree of spread of the data. Tho most common statistics used as measures of dispersion are the range, the interquartile range, and the standart deviation. |
| **range** | 极差 | The range of the numbers in a group of data is the difference between the greatest number *G* in the data and the least number *L* in the data; that is, *G* - *L*. |
| **outlier** | 离群值，异常值 | Outliers are unusually small or unusually large in comparison with the rest of the data. |
| **interquartile** | 四分位数，四分点 |  |
| **interquartile range** | 四分位数间距，四分位差 | A measure of dispersion that is not usually affected by outliers is the interquartile range. It is defined as the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile; that is, $Q_3 - Q_1$. |
| **boxplot， box-and-whisker plot** | 箱线图，箱形图，盒须图 | $L, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, G$ can be plotted along a number line to show where the four quartile groups lie. Such plots are called boxplots or box-and-whisker plots, because a box is used to identify each of the two middle quartile groups of data, and "whiskers" extend outward from the boxes to the least and greatest values. |
| **standard deviation (population standard deviation)** | 标准差 | The standard deviation is a measure of spread that depends on each number in the list. Using the mean as the center of the data, the standard deviation takes into account how much each value differs from the eman and then takes a type of average of these differences. |
| **sample standard deviation** | 样本标准差 | The sample standard deviation is qualified with the word "sample" and is computed by dividing the sum of the squared differences by *n* - 1 instead of *n*. |
| **standardization** | 标准化 | The process of subtracting the mean from each value and then dividing the result by the standard deviation is called standardization. Standardization is a useful tool because for each data value, it provides a measure of position relative to the rest of the data independently of the variable for which the data was collected and the units of the variable. **(?)** |

* Measures of Central Tendency: P140

* Measures of Position: P142

* Measures of Dispersion: P143

  * **Example 4.2.9**: P146 (Calculating standard deviations)

  * Fact about standard deviation: In *any group of data,* most of the data are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

    Thus, when *any group of data* are standardized, most of the data are transformed to an interval on the number line centered about 0 and extending from -3 to 3. The mean is always transformed to 0.

| **members, elements**                                        | 元素           | The objects of a set are called members or elements.         |
| **finite**                                                   | 有限的（集合） | Some sets are finite, which means that their members can be completely counted. <br>*eg:* For any finite set *S*, the number of elements of *S* is denoted by \|S\|. |
| **infinite**                                                 | 无限的（集合） | Sets that are not finite are called infinite sets, such as the set of all integers. |
| **empty set**                                                | 空集           | A set that has no members is called the empty set and is denoted by the symbol $\varnothing$. |
| **nonempty**                                                 | 非空集         | A set with one or more members is called nonempty.           |
| **subset**                                                   | 子集           | If *A* and *B* are sets and all of the members of *A* are also members of *B*, then *A* is a subset of *B*. |
| **list**                                                     | 表 **(?)**     | A list is like a finite set, having members that can all be listed, but with two differences. In a list, the members are ordered-that is, rearranging the members of a list makes it a different list. Thus, the terms "first element,""second element," and so on, make sense in a list. Also, elements can be repeated in a list and the repetitions matter. |
| **intersection**                                             | 交集           | The intersection of *S* and *T* is the set of all elements that are in both *S* and *T* and is denoted by $S \cap T$. |
| **union**                                                    | 并集           | The union of *S* and *T* is the set of all elements that are in either *S* or *T* or both and is denoted by $S \cup T$. |
| **disjoint / mutually exclusive**                            | 互斥，不相交   | If sets *S* and *T* have no elements in common, they are called disjoint or mutually exclusive. |
| **Venn diagram**                                             | 文氏图         | In a Venn diagram, sets are represented by circular regions that overlap if they have elements in common but do not overlap if they are disjoint. |
| **universal set**                                            | 全集           | Sometimes the circular regions are drawn inside a rectangular region, which represents a universal set, of which all other sets involved are subsets. |
| **inclusion-exclusion principle**                            | 容斥原理       | The number of elements in the union of two sets equals the sum of their individual numbers of elements minus the number of elements in their intersection. <br>\| A $\cup$ B \| = \| A \| + \| B \| - \| A $\cap $ B \| |
| **multiplication principle**                                 | 乘法原理       | Suppose there are two choices to be made sequentially and that the second choice is independent of the first choice. Suppose also that there are *k* different possibilities for the first choice and *m* different possibilities for the second choice. The multiplication principle states that under those conditions, there are *km* different possibilities for the pair of choices. |
| **permutation**                                              | 排列           | The number of ways to order the *n* objects is equal to the product $n(n-1)(n-2)...(3)(2)(1)$. Each order is called a permutation, and the product above is called the number of permutations of *n* objects. |
| **factorial**                                                | 阶乘           | Because products of the form $n(n-1)(n-2)...(3)(2)(1)$ occur frequently when counting objects, a special symbol $n!$, called n-factorial, is used to denote this product. |
| **permutations of n objects taken k at a time**              | n中选k的排列数 | $\displaystyle P_n^k =\ _nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$           |

#### 4.4 Probability

| English                                       | Chinese            | Remark & Example                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **probability experiment, random experiment** | 概率实验，随机实验 | A probability experiment, also called a random experiment, is an experiment for which the result, or outcome, is uncertain. We assume that all of the possible outcomes of an experiment are known before the experiment is performed, but which outcome will actually occur is unknown. |
| **outcome**                                   | 结果，输出，取值   |                                                              |
| **sample space**                              | 样本空间           | The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space, and any particular set of outcomes is called an event. |
| **event**                                     | 事件               | *eg0:* The event that both *E* and *F* occur, that is, outcomes in the set $E \cap F$.<br>*eg1:* The event that *E* or *F*, or both, occur, that is, outcomes in the set $E \cup F$. <br>*eg2:* It is common to use the shorter notation "*E* and *F*" instead of "both *E* and *F* occur" and use "*E* or *F*" instead of "*E* or *F* or both occur." |
| **probability**                               | 概率               | The probability of an event is a number from 0 to 1, inclusive, that indicates the likelihood that the event occurs when the experiment is performed. <br>*eg0:* If an event *E* is certain to occur, then P(E) = 1. <br>*eg1:* If an event *E* is certain not to occur, then P(E) = 0. <br>*eg2:* If an event *E* is possible but not certain to occur, then 0 < P(E) < 1. <br>*eg3:* The probability that an event *E* will not occur is equal to 1 - P(E). <br>*eg4:* If *E* is an event, then the probability of *E* is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in *E*. <br>*eg5:* The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of an experiment is 1. <br>*eg6:* P(either *E* or *F*, or both, occur) = P(E) + P(F) - P(both *E* and *F* occur), which is the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to probability. <br>*eg7:* If *E* and *F* are mutually exclusive, then P(both *E* and *F* occur) = 0, and therefore, P(either *E* of *F*, or both, occur) = P(E) + P(F). <br>*eg8:* *E* and *F* are said to be independent if the occurrence of either event does not affect the occurrence of the other. If two events *E* and *F* are independent, then P(both *E* and *F* occur) = P(E)P(F). <br>*eg9:* **Note** that if P(E) $\not =$ 0 and P(F) $\not =$ 0, then events *E* and *F* cannot be both mutually exclusive and independent. For if *E* and *F* are independent, then P(both *E* and *F* occur) = P(E)P(F) $\not =$ 0, but if *E* and *F* are mutually exclusive, then P(both *E* and *F* occur) = 0. |
| **random selection**                          | 随机选择，随机抽样 | The assumption of random selection means that each of the names is equally likely to be selected. |
| **equally likely**                            | 等可能，等概率     | In general, for a random experiment with a finite number of possible outcomes, if each outcome is equally likely to occur, then the probability that an event *E* occurs is defined by $\displaystyle P(E) = \frac{\text{the number of outcomes in the event E}}{\text{the number of possible outcomes in the experiment}}$ |
| **mutually exclusive**                        | 互斥               | Events that cannot occur at the same time are said to be mutually exclusive. |
| **independent**                               | 独立               | **(Notice the difference between "mutually exclusive" and "independent". "Mutually exclusive" means there is only one experiment with many outcomes. "Independent" means two experiments does not affect each other.)** |


#### 4.5 Distributions of Data, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions

> In data analysis, variables whose values depend on chance play an important role in linking distributions of data to probability distributions. Such variables are called random variables.

| English                                                | Chinese                            | Remark & Example                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **class**                                              | 类                                 | *eg:* The measurements were grouped into 50 intervals, or classes, of 10 hours each. |
| **distribution curve, density curve, frequency curve** | 分布曲线，密度曲线，频率曲线       | The distribution can be modeled by a smooth curve that is close to the tops of the bars. Such a model retains the shape of the distribution but is independent of classes. The area under the curve that models the distribution is 1. This model curve is called a distribution curve, but it has other names as well, including density curve and frequency curve. <br>The purpose of the distribution curve is to give a good illustration of a large distribution of numerical data that does not depend on specific classes. |
| **random variable**                                    | 随机变量                           | Given a distribution of data, a variable, say *X*, may be used to represent a randomly chosen value from the distribution. Such a variable *X* is an example of a random variable, which is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random experiment. <br>The concept of a random variable is more general than representing a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data. A random variable can be any quantity whose value is the result of a random experiment. The possible values of the random variable are the same as the outcomes of the experiment. So any random experiment with numerical outcomes naturally has a random variable associated with it. |
| **probability distribution**                           | 概率分布                           | A fundamental link between data distributions and probability distributions: For a random variable that represents a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data, the probability distribution of the random variable is the same as the relative frequency distribution of the data. |
| **mean of the random variable *X* / expected value**   | 随机变量*X*的均值/数学期望，预期值 | Another name for the mean of a random variable is expected value. <br>The mean of the random variable *X* is the sum of the products XP(X) for all values of *X*, that is, the sum of each value of *X* multiplied by its corresponding probability P(X). |
| **discrete random variables**                          | 离散随机变量                       | Whose values consist of discrete points on a number line. <br>**Fundamental Link:** In a histogram representing the probability distribution of a random variable, the area of each bar is proportional to the probability represented by the bar. |
| **uniform distribution**                               | 均匀分布                           | Each of the bars in the histogram of the probability distribution would have the same height. Such a flat histogram indicates a uniform distribution, since the probability is distributed uniformly over all possible outcomes. |
| **approximately normally distributed**                 | 近似正态分布                       | Many natural processes yield data that have a relative frequency distribution shaped somewhat like a bell. Such data are said to be approximately normally distributed and have four properties. <br>Property 1: The mean, median, and mode are all nearly equal. <br>Property 2: The data are grouped fairly symmetrically about the mean. <br>Property 3: About two-thirds of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. <br>Property 4: Almost all of the data within 2 standard deviations of the mean. |
| **continuous probability distribution**                | 连续概率分布                       | The region below a distribution curve represents a distribution called a continuous probability distribution. There are many different continuous probability distributions, but the most important one is the normal distribution, which has a bell-shaped curve. <br>The area of the region under the curve is 1, and the areas of vertical slices of the region, like the areas of the bars of a histogram, are equal to probabilities of a random variable associated with the distribution. Such a random variable is called a continuous random variable. |
| **normal distribution**                                | 正态分布                           | The properties listed above for the approximately normal distribution of data hold for the normal distribution, except that the mean, median, and mode are exactly the same and the distribution is perfectly symmetric about the mean. <br>A normal distribution, though always shaped like a bell, can be centered around any mean and can be spread out to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the standard deviation. The less the standard deviation, the less spread out the curve is; that is to say, at the mean the curve is higher and as you move away from the mean in either direction it drops down toward the horizontal axis faster. |
| **continuous random variable**                         | 连续随机变量                       | Continuous random variable plays the same role as a random variable that represents a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data. The main difference is that we seldom consider the event in which a  continuous random variables is equal to a single values like X=3; rather, we consider events that are described by intervals of values such as 1 \< X \< 3 and X \> 10. |
| **standard normal distribution**                       | 标准正态分布                       | The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation equal to 1. To transform a normal distribution with a mean of *m* and a standard deviation of *d* to a standard normal distribution, you standardize the values; that is, you subtract *m* from any observed value of the normal distribution and then divide the result by *d*. <br>*eg0:* 1 deviation from the mean: P = 0.683 <br>*eg1:* 3 deviation from the mean: P = 0.9987 |
