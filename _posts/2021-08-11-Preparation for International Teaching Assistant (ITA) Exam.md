## International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Exam

> Ref: 
> [ITA - ALI](https://ali.usc.edu/ita/), 
> [Instructions on online ITA exam - ALI](https://ali.usc.edu/online-ita-exam-instructions/)
> [ITA terms - ALI](https://ali.usc.edu/ita-terms/)

#### Interview Contents

1. A brief interview in which you talk about your educational experience and interest in graduate studies at USC. (3-5 minutes)
2. An explanation of a term or concept (approximately 7 minutes). Two terms or concepts will be sent to you 24 hours prior to the exam so that you can prepare a simulated classroom presentation on one of those terms or concepts.
3. Option to choose ONE of the following tools in your presentation:
   1. a maximum of 2 power point slides
   2. a physical blackboard or a white board
   3. a smart board or Zoom whiteboard
4. The examiners will act as students and will ask questions about the term.

#### Presentation Contents

In addition to providing a **definition** and **explaining the importance of your term**, it is recommended that your presentation include one or more of the following: 

1. Examples (practical and/or personal)
2. Analogies (e.g. "The structure of an atom is similar to that of the solar system.")
3. Comparisons and/or contrasts
4. Word origin (meanings of prefix, suffix, root)
5. Drawings or diagrams
