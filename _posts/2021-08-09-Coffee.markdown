The coffee can be basically categorized into three types according to the roast: light, medium and dark. Generally speaking, light roast coffee is more sour than dark roast coffee, while the latter one is more bitter.

Starbucks Veranda Blend is a Blonde roasted (light roasted) Arabica coffee. It tastes acidic, not bitter, not sweet for me. Adding milk is one way to reduce the acidity.
