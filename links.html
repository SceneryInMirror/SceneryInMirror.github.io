Fugoes is the most talented genius I have ever known. He is a professional in mathematics, physics, and software. Discussion with him is always exciting and inspiring.

yzhan is a reliable and thoughtful friend. He is enthusiastic about his research. As roommates in PKU, the life of studying, playing, and eating with him is a treasure to me.

Richsoap is full of interesting and surprising ideas. He is always willing to learn new skills, experience new challenges, and enjoy life. He never waits if he decides.

Yinghua is reliable and humorous. I learned a lot about conducting academic research and dealing with colleagues. I always appreciate the support from his family during my Ph.D. life, especially during the pandemic.
