<h2>
    Lab Introduction
</h2>
<p>
We have two subgroups, focusing on cyber-physical system design and trustworthy SoC design respectively. Trustworthy SoC design group now is interested in logic encryption attack and defense methods on gate-level netlists, as well as the evaluation metrics and general models.
