I am Kaixin Yang (杨凯欣), a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://descyphy.usc.edu/">DesCyPhy Lab</a> at University of Southern California (USC), advised by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nuzzo/Pierluigi">Prof. Pierluigi Nuzzo</a>. I am interested in hardware security and trustworthy hardware design, as well as machine learning (ML)-based approaches to them. Recently, I focus on logic locking for gate-level VLSI design, Satisfiability (SAT) based attacks and ML-based attacks on encrypted design, secure high level synthesis, metrics for evaluating and guiding trustworthy design, and design space exploration for risk-free hardware design.
