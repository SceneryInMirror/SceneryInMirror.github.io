<p>The review of arithmetic begins with integers, fractions, and decimals and progresses to the set of real numbers. The basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are discussed, along with exponents and roots. The review of arithmetic ends with the concepts of ratio and percent.</p>

<td><strong>probability</strong></td>
<td>概率</td>
<td>The probability of an event is a number from 0 to 1, inclusive, that indicates the likelihood that the event occurs when the experiment is performed. <br><em>eg0:</em> If an event <em>E</em> is certain to occur, then P(E) = 1. <br><em>eg1:</em> If an event <em>E</em> is certain not to occur, then P(E) = 0. <br><em>eg2:</em> If an event <em>E</em> is possible but not certain to occur, then 0 &lt; P(E) &lt; 1. <br><em>eg3:</em> The probability that an event <em>E</em> will not occur is equal to 1 - P(E). <br><em>eg4:</em> If <em>E</em> is an event, then the probability of <em>E</em> is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in <em>E</em>. <br><em>eg5:</em> The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of an experiment is 1. <br><em>eg6:</em> P(either <em>E</em> or <em>F</em>, or both, occur) = P(E) + P(F) - P(both <em>E</em> and <em>F</em> occur), which is the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to probability. <br><em>eg7:</em> If <em>E</em> and <em>F</em> are mutually exclusive, then P(both <em>E</em> and <em>F</em> occur) = 0, and therefore, P(either <em>E</em> of <em>F</em>, or both, occur) = P(E) + P(F). <br><em>eg8:</em> <em>E</em> and <em>F</em> are said to be independent if the occurrence of either event does not affect the occurrence of the other.

<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>class</strong></td>
<td>类</td>
<td><em>eg:</em> The measurements were grouped into 50 intervals, or classes, of 10 hours each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>distribution curve, density curve, frequency curve</strong></td>
<td>分布曲线，密度曲线，频率曲线</td>
<td>The distribution can be modeled by a smooth curve that is close to the tops of the bars. Such a model retains the shape of the distribution but is independent of classes. The area under the curve that models the distribution is 1. This model curve is called a distribution curve, but it has other names as well, including density curve and frequency curve. <br>The purpose of the distribution curve is to give a good illustration of a large distribution of numerical data that does not depend on specific classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>random variable</strong></td>
<td>随机变量</td>
<td>Given a distribution of data, a variable, say <em>X</em>, may be used to represent a randomly chosen value from the distribution. Such a variable <em>X</em> is an example of a random variable, which is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random experiment. <br>The concept of a random variable is more general than representing a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data. A random variable can be any quantity whose value is the result of a random experiment. The possible values of the random variable are the same as the outcomes of the experiment. So any random experiment with numerical outcomes naturally has a random variable associated with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>probability distribution</strong></td>
<td>概率分布</td>
<td>A fundamental link between data distributions and probability distributions: For a random variable that represents a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data, the probability distribution of the random variable is the same as the relative frequency distribution of the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>mean of the random variable <em>X</em> / expected value</strong></td>
<td>随机变量<em>X</em>的均值/数学期望，预期值</td>
<td>Another name for the mean of a random variable is expected value. <br>The mean of the random variable <em>X</em> is the sum of the products XP(X) for all values of <em>X</em>, that is, the sum of each value of <em>X</em> multiplied by its corresponding probability P(X).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>discrete random variables</strong></td>
<td>离散随机变量</td>
<td>Whose values consist of discrete points on a number line. <br><strong>Fundamental Link:</strong> In a histogram representing the probability distribution of a random variable, the area of each bar is proportional to the probability represented by the bar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>uniform distribution</strong></td>
<td>均匀分布</td>
<td>Each of the bars in the histogram of the probability distribution would have the same height. Such a flat histogram indicates a uniform distribution, since the probability is distributed uniformly over all possible outcomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>approximately normally distributed</strong></td>
<td>近似正态分布</td>
<td>Many natural processes yield data that have a relative frequency distribution shaped somewhat like a bell. Such data are said to be approximately normally distributed and have four properties. <br>Property 1: The mean, median, and mode are all nearly equal. <br>Property 2: The data are grouped fairly symmetrically about the mean. <br>Property 3: About two-thirds of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. <br>Property 4: Almost all of the data within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>continuous probability distribution</strong></td>
<td>连续概率分布</td>
<td>The region below a distribution curve represents a distribution called a continuous probability distribution. There are many different continuous probability distributions, but the most important one is the normal distribution, which has a bell-shaped curve. <br>The area of the region under the curve is 1, and the areas of vertical slices of the region, like the areas of the bars of a histogram, are equal to probabilities of a random variable associated with the distribution. Such a random variable is called a continuous random variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>normal distribution</strong></td>
<td>正态分布</td>
<td>The properties listed above for the approximately normal distribution of data hold for the normal distribution, except that the mean, median, and mode are exactly the same and the distribution is perfectly symmetric about the mean. <br>A normal distribution, though always shaped like a bell, can be centered around any mean and can be spread out to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the standard deviation. The less the standard deviation, the less spread out the curve is; that is to say, at the mean the curve is higher and as you move away from the mean in either direction it drops down toward the horizontal axis faster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>continuous random variable</strong></td>
<td>连续随机变量</td>
<td>Continuous random variable plays the same role as a random variable that represents a randomly chosen value from a distribution of data. The main difference is that we seldom consider the event in which a  continuous random variables is equal to a single values like X=3; rather, we consider events that are described by intervals of values such as 1 &lt; X &lt; 3 and X &gt; 10.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>standard normal distribution</strong></td>
<td>标准正态分布</td>
<td>The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation equal to 1. To transform a normal distribution with a mean of <em>m</em> and a standard deviation of <em>d</em> to a standard normal distribution, you standardize the values; that is, you subtract <em>m</em> from any observed value of the normal distribution and then divide the result by <em>d</em>. <br><em>eg0:</em> 1 deviation from the mean: P = 0.683 <br><em>eg1:</em> 3 deviation from the mean: P = 0.9987</td>
