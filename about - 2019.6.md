**Welcome to my blog!**

Hi! My name is 杨凯欣 (Kaixin Yang), a senior student from Peking University. As an undergrad, my major is Electrical Engineering and I have a strong interest in anything related to computer.

I love sports, especially soccer and basketball. Cristiano Ronaldo and Kobe Byrant are always my heroes. I love all kinds of music, too.

Now I'm admitted by USC and will continue my academic career as a PhD candidate since this August. Good luck with myself!
